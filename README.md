## Repo Structure

As I am not paying for hosting, the code has to be downloaded to the device you want to run it on.

It will use a local database so is not transferable across devices at this time.

It is also a product I'm documenting my processes on so it includes notes, diagrams, and commentary.

Therefore, all the code and notes are included in this one repo.

The structure is as follows.

```bash
dinner-spinner/
└── client/
├── design/
├── server/
```

**Client**: React Typescript frontend
**Design**: process, notes, diagrams
**Server**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow/smorest, SQLite backend
